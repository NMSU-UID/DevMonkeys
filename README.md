Description: 
  An Android Mobile application that will allow users who utilize the Las Cruces Bus System to be able to enter in a starting location and a destination location and be able to find the best bus routes through out the city of Las Cruces. 
  
Requirements:
  - Routes need to be color coded on the map.
  - Will create a map key or help tab for new users.
  - Display addresses of bus stops on routes.
  - Bus stops need to be number coded. Can refer to LC Road Runner Transit PDF.
  - Include pdf's of routes in seperate tab.
  - Sorting/Search Algorithm needs to be fast. Shouldn't take more than 20-30 seconds to find best bus route (GOAL)
  - User needs to enter in full addresses of location they want to go to. 
  - User needs to enter in addresses within the Las Cruces city limits. 
  - On app initialization there shouls be a loading screen ex. Netlix Mobile App, Uber Mobile App, MTV Mobile App.
  - Users can save locations so they don't have to reenter them in.
  - App Logo.
  - Provide written directions to get to location.
  - Integrating javascript, HTML5, CSS inside Android Studio to import MapView.
  - Create Mockup/Wireframes for the interface. 
 
Questions that need answered:
  - Create MapView using Leaflet or MapQuest Api 
  - What will happen if routes intersect or have transfers? Do routes intersect?
  - Do we base the result of "best route" by bus stops or by the whole route. 
  - Do we calculate distance from stop to stop as well as the entirety of that route?
  - If it doesn't lead to the exact location they want, do we want to GPS them to that location based on them walking the rest of the way.
